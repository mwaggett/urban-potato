# urban-potato

Admit it. You've been at home alone on Saturday night, hell, ANY night, feeling bored, lonely, and too lazy to do anything about it.

You like to think, hey, tonight might be the night I go to that meetup I've been eyeing for months! Yeah, right.

Okay, fine, fine. But I'll totally hit up that friend I've been meaning to hang out with for weeks but just keep forgetting to text.

It's fun to pretend you're going to do something exciting with your evening, but let's face it. You're not leaving this apartment. BUT you're still bored and lonely. what do???

### That's where **urban-potato** comes in.

I bet you love Buzzfeed quizzes. It's okay, I do too. They're amusing, but they're unrealistic. If you asked Buzzfeed what to do tonight, it would probably tell you to pick a comfort food and a baby animal and then tell you to go to the local bar to scope out cuties in the area.

HEY. Hey. Focus. I know you considered that for a second, it sounds kind of appealing, I get it. But we're being realisitic here.

By simply running

urban-potato gives you a fun-filled evening of easy, feel-good, stay-at-home activities that you were probably gonna end up doing anyway.
